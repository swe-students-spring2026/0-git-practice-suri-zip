## Why I find this interesting

I found this article interesting because it shows how AI is changing the way we write code. Instead of engineers doing all the coding themselves, they might soon focus more on reviewing, guiding, and thinking about the bigger picture. It made me realize that the role of software engineers could become more about problem solving and less about typing code. We need to be more product-minded and also comfortable overseeing the system and guiding AI.

It was interesting how quickly experienced software engineers began relying on artificial intelligence to write code for them. Someone writing code by hand would probably fall behind if the others on their team are all using LLMs. In school we often aren't allowed to use generated code so that we learn basic concepts, so how will learning new skills in the workforce change when it is totally allowed there? -Grace
